# Product Vision

1. As the world continues to develop, the study of humanities is constantly undergoing fundamental changes and it is becoming increasingly important for historians to approach their studies in a global context, rather than a European context. In the field of philosophy, specific and efficient research on a global scale is becoming more challenging for philosophers to handle, especially as the scope of their research continues to expand. While there are many resources that cater to learning about different philosophies from around the world, there doesnâ€™t exist an efficient way to catalog and compare these varying ideas in a way that would be beneficial to a studying philosopher.
This is where the University of Hildesheim begins their work to modernize the study of philosophy and create an environment that makes global philosophies easily accessible. Currently, they have a large database of cataloged papers, but their organization is very linear and more akin to a file hierarchy than a robust query system.  
Our goal is to help them revamp their entire database by creating a robust tagging system that allows newly cataloged papers to be easily indexed. With this new system, researchers will be able to add new texts, efficiently filter papers by multiple categories (language, time, author, etc.), and graphically visualize the data (through word clouds, heat maps, network of texts based on their tags, etc.).
